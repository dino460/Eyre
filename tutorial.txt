## MOVEMENT ##
- Movement is handled by first typing 'move', 'go' or similar commands, then,
 you type the direction you want to go among 'up', 'down', 'right' or 'left'
 or their cardinal correspondents.

## EXAMINATION ##
- Examination works by typing 'look', 'examine' or anything similar to reveal
 more information about an item or your current location.

## INVENTORY ##
- The inventory lists the current items in your handy backpack while also making
 it possible to 'look' your items and/or 'use' them.

## COMBAT ##
- During combat you may fight, heal or flee (using the proper commands that are
 equal to their action names)
  > Fighting lets you inflict damage to an enemy either by a STRENGTH (frc)
   based fisical attack or by a INTELIGENCE (intl) based magic attack.
   The first is resisted by CONSTITUTION (con), while the later by intl.
  > Healing lets you recover hp by consuming potions. You can also use potions
   to 'overheal', getting higher hp than what would be possible according to
   your class and attributes.
  > Fleeing initiates a contest of DEXTERITY (dex), where having a higher score
   makes it easier to flee, but the result is ultimately decided by luck, 
   through a random number generated to both player and enemy. Succeding enables the
   player to avoid combat.

## MAP ##
- Typing 'map' prints the overall world map.

 see it's JOB, ATTRIBUTE TYPE, HEALTH POINTS (hp), MAGIC POINTS (mp), STRENGTH
